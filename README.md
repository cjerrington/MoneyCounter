## Project setup
You can use yarn or npm to run the software locally. I typically use npm. 
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

## Deploying
I am using [netlify.com](netlify.com) to run a build for this and then serve it live from Github. This allows a single repository to be able to have a way to share code and build online for live updates.
